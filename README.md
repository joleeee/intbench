Benchmarks for various big integer implementaitons, mainly for deciding what
256 bit unsigned integers to use in EVM projects.

# Todo
* AVX2
* bench more crates
* implement my own
* tests that utilize the full 256 bits and not just the lower part
* overflowing vs saturating vs panic
* bench square roots
* better bench output formatting
* signed integers

PRs are very welcome :)
